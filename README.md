# Romance Orthographic Reintegrationism

ROR, or Romance Orthographic Reintegrationism, is a set of guidelines that proposes how Romance minority languages (RMLs) should design their orthographies (writing systems) to align more closely with the major Romance languages like Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, Occitan, French, and Romanian.

Instead of creating one uniform spelling for all RMLs, ROR offers principles that encourage orthographic similarity across the Romance family, focusing on historical accuracy and relative simplicity. The goal is to improve mutual intelligibility between Romance languages and reduce the isolation of minority languages, while still allowing each language its individuality.

[Here](PDF_v0.5.pdf) is the current version of the documentation about ROR in PDF format.
