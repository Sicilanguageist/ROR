# Romance Orthographic Reintegrationism

**THE FIRST CASE STUDY (WALLOON) IS NOW PRESENT IN THE PDF**

ROR, or Romance Orthographic Reintegrationism, is a set of guidelines that proposes how Romance minority languages (RMLs) should design their orthographies (writing systems) to align more closely with the major Romance languages like Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, Occitan, French, and Romanian.

Instead of creating one uniform spelling for all RMLs, ROR offers principles that encourage orthographic similarity across the Romance family, focusing on historical accuracy and relative simplicity. The goal is to improve mutual intelligibility between Romance languages and reduce the isolation of minority languages, while still allowing each language its individuality.

- To see the original YouTube video about ROR, click [here](https://youtu.be/T8GsnYJGPq8?si=RHE-02wEer5mRlKx). It is more limited in scope, it is less specific and more theoretical.
