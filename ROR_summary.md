## Introduction

### Purposes
- Ground (or reintegrate) the orthographies of RMLs into the common practices of the languages of reference by etymologically justifying certain spelling choices
- Leave room for a diversity of outcomes, letting RMLs maintain their own individuality and identity
- Increase mutual intelligibility with other Romance languages in writing
- Breake the linguistic isolation most minority languages face
- Fosters etymological research and the creation of an active scholarly community

## Guidelines

### General Principles
- Avoid diacritics, letters and multigraphs (di-, tri- and quadrigraphs) that are not used in the languages of reference (like &lt;k, w&gt;).
- Acknowledge what these orthographic conventions are and try and understand what their *etymological* role is within the system they are borrowed from. Etymologically established spelling conventions can be extended to non-etymological contexts (see e.g. Spanish &lt;j&gt;).
- Romance reintegrationism prioritises reader clarity over writer ease by aiming for each grapheme to represent only one phoneme, even if a phoneme has multiple spellings.
- Avoid double marking, i.e. marking a feature or element more than once.
- Avoid using diacritics frequently.
